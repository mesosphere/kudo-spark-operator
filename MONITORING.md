Out of the box, the `kudo-spark-operator` has enabled metrics reporting. 
By default, it supports integration with the [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator).

Prometheus Operator relies on `ServiceMonitor` kind which describes the set of targets to be monitored. 
KUDO Spark Operator configures `ServiceMonitor`s for both the Operator and submitted Spark Applications automatically 
when monitoring is enabled.

#### Exporting Spark Operator and Spark Application metrics to Prometheus

##### Prerequisite
* The *`prometheus-operator`*.
If you don't already have the `prometheus-operator` installed on your Kubernetes cluster, you can do so by following
the [quick start guide](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator#quickstart).
* The *`kudo-spark-operator`*. [Installing and using spark operator](https://github.com/mesosphere/kudo-spark-operator/blob/master/README.md#installing-and-using-spark-operator).

1) Create a `ServiceMonitor` for Spark: 
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
   kind: ServiceMonitor
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: prometheus-operator
       release: prometheus-kubeaddons
     name: spark-cluster-monitor
   spec:
     endpoints:
       - interval: 5s
         port: metrics
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         spark/servicemonitor: "true"
   EOF
   ```
1) Create the metrics endpoint service. Feel free to modify the service port in the yaml in case you are going to expose 
the metrics on other one and see further instructions in next step.
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: spark-application-metrics
     labels:
       "spark/servicemonitor": "true"
   spec:
     ports:
       - port: 8090
         name: metrics
     clusterIP: None
     selector:
       "metrics-exposed": "true"
   EOF
   ```  
1) Composing your Spark Application yaml:
   - use the following Spark image which includes the `JMXPrometheus` exporter jar: `mesosphere/spark:spark-2.4.3-hadoop-2.9-k8s`
   - enable Driver and Executors metrics reporting by adding the following configuration into `SparkApplication` `spec` section:
     ```yaml
       monitoring:
         exposeDriverMetrics: true
         exposeExecutorMetrics: true
         prometheus:
           jmxExporterJar: "/prometheus/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.11.0.jar"
           port: 8090
     ```  
   - if it's necessary to expose the metrics endpoint on a port other than `8090`, do the following:
     1) change the `port` value in the `SparkApplication` yaml definition (`spec.monitoring.prometheus.port`)
     1) specify the same port when installing the `kudo-spark-operator`:  
     ```
     kubectl kudo install <operator> -p appMetricsPort=<desired_port>
     ```
   - Mark `driver` and/or `executor` with the label `metrics-exposed: "true"` -
     ```yaml
     spec:
       driver:
         labels:
            metrics-exposed: "true"
       executor:
         labels:
           metrics-exposed: "true"
     ```
   - Install the SparkApplication:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f <path_to_the_application_yaml>   
     ```
   Full configuration example is available in [specs/spark-application.yaml](specs/spark-application.yaml).
1) Now, go to the prometheus dashboard (e.g. `<kubernetes_endpoint_url>/ops/portal/prometheus/graph`) and search for metrics 
starting with 'spark'. The Prometheus URI might be different depending on how you configured and installed the `prometheus-operator`. 

#### Dashboards
 * [Spark Applications Dashboard](/dashboards/grafana_spark_applications.json) 
 * [Spark Operator Dashboard](dashboards/grafana_spark_operator.json)
 
 Dashboard installation : 
1) Open the Grafana site (e.g. `<kubernetes_endpoint_url>/ops/portal/grafana`).  
1) Press + button and pick `Import` item from the menu.  
1) Copy content of the dashboard json file and paste it to the textarea on importing form.
